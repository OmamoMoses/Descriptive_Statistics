# Wilson Company Fertilizer Plant Production Function Analysis.
## Introduction.
The Cobb-Douglas production function has been widely applied in various fields of economics, including macroeconomics, microeconomics, and growth theory. It serves as a fundamental tool for understanding the relationships between inputs and outputs in production processes.
The Cobb-Douglas production function is often represented as follows: Q=A⋅K^α*L^(1−α) where based on the gathered data: Q is the output (quantity of fertilizer produced in 000 TONS), A is a constant is the capital input ($000), L is the labor input (000 Worker Hours), α is the output elasticity of capital, and1−α is the output elasticity of labor. However, the Cobb-Douglas production function after taking the natural logarithm is transformed to a linear relationship: ln(Q)=ln(A)+α⋅ln(K)+(1−α) ⋅ln(L).
